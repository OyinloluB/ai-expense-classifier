# 🧠 AI-Powered Expense Classifier

An intelligent API that classifies natural-language expense descriptions into categories like `Transportation`, `Food & Drink`, `Entertainment`, and more — powered by machine learning and FastAPI.

It also supports:
- 📦 Batch classification
- 📸 OCR classification from images/receipts
- 💡 Confidence scoring for each prediction

## 🚀 Features

- 🔤 **Text Classification** — Predicts expense categories from written descriptions.
- 🖼️ **OCR Support** — Extracts and classifies text from images (e.g. receipts).
- 🧠 **ML-Powered** — Trained using scikit-learn with `TfidfVectorizer` and `LogisticRegression`.
- 🔄 **Batch Input** — Classify multiple expenses in a single call.
- ⚡ **FastAPI Backend** — Modern async API with auto-generated Swagger docs.
